# Flutter FileMaker for Desktop
 An open sourcce implementation of FileMaker for Desktop built in Flutter

---

## Initial Setup
### Appwrite
For a self-hosted solution, you will need to setup an Appwrite server. Local and cloud hosted solutions are planned for future releases. Self-hosted was chosen first because I believe it would handle most use-cases for this - locally maintained server for a small-ish business.
Install Appwrite from directions on their site: [Appwrite : Self-hosting](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting).
Once installed, have your Appwrite Server URL and Appwrite Project ID available, you will be prompted for these on first launch of Flutter Filemaker for Windows. 

## Roadmap
Initial focus will be on Windows (>10), once the basic features are built out and working, additional platform support will be added (Linux, Android - MacOS and iOS last, unless someone decides to take that portion of the project.)
